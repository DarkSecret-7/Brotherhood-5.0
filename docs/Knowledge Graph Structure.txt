1. Core principles
Before naming tools, these rules matter more than the stack itself:
* Convention over cleverness
* Stateless services
* Everything versioned
* Everything inspectable
* Zero magic
If someone new joins, they should think:
“Oh, I’ve seen this before.”

2. Tech Stack
* Language and Framework – Python + FastAPI
* Database – PostgreSQL
* ORM/DB Layer – SQLAlchemy 2.x + Alembic
* Auth – JWT + OAuth2

3. Version control inside the product (critical)
This is where your system becomes Wikipedia-grade.
Conceptually:
* Append-only tables
* No hard deletes
* Every change = new row
* Old versions remain addressable
Implementation pattern:
* entity
* entity_version
* change_log
* user
This maps perfectly to Postgres + SQLAlchemy.

4. API design (handoff-friendly)
REST first, even if you add GraphQL later.
Rules:
* No deeply nested endpoints
* Explicit resource boundaries
* Stable URLs
Example:
POST   /nodes
POST   /nodes/{id}/versions
GET    /nodes/{id}
GET    /nodes/{id}/history
This screams “serious system” to experienced devs.

5. Background jobs / automation (QoL only)
Celery + Redis
Use it for:
* Validation checks
* Index updates
* Diff generation
* Notifications

6. Infrastructure (everyone knows this)
Containerization
Docker + Docker Compose
Mandatory.
No debate.
Deployment (pick one)
* AWS (ECS or EC2)
* DigitalOcean
* Fly.io
Avoid Kubernetes until forced.

7. Dev hygiene (this is how you attract contributors)
* Black + Ruff (formatting & linting)
* mypy (typing)
* pre-commit hooks
* pytest
* .env.example
This signals:
“This project is safe to work on.”

8. What NOT to do (important)
Avoid:
* Custom DSLs
* Experimental DBs
* Heavy LLM dependencies in core logic
* Over-abstracted service layers
* “Smart” pipelines no one understands
9. What “local-first” should mean (important distinction)
? Yes to:
* Dockerized API
* Dockerized Postgres
* Versioned migrations
* Seed scripts
* Fake auth / single admin
* Local file storage (for now)
? No to:
* Hardcoded paths
* Dev-only hacks
* “We’ll fix this later” shortcuts
* Logic that assumes one user forever
Local-first ? sloppy-first.
